## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **UGC-focused Technical Lead and Software Engineer** with hands-on experience across game development, platform engineering, and full-stack systems.

I currently work within the **Fortnite UGC ecosystem**, leading prototyping, innovation, and technical direction for scalable creator-driven experiences. I enjoy building systems that balance **technical depth, player engagement, and long-term maintainability**.

I’ve worked across startups, creator platforms, and enterprise environments — from shipping production web apps to leading UGC teams and advising on discovery strategy.
